üîπ Artificial Intelligence (AI) Viva Questions & Answers
Unit 1: Introduction & Agents
Q1. What is Artificial Intelligence?
A1. AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and solve problems.

Q2. What is an intelligent agent?
A2. An intelligent agent perceives its environment and takes actions to maximize its chances of success.

Q3. Define rationality in AI.
A3. Rationality is doing the right thing, given what the agent knows.

Unit 2: Problem Solving using Search
Q4. Difference between informed and uninformed search?
A4. Uninformed search has no domain knowledge (e.g., BFS, DFS); informed uses heuristics (e.g., A*, Greedy).

Q5. What is a heuristic function?
A5. A function that estimates the cost of the cheapest path from the current node to the goal.

Q6. What is A* search?
A6. A* search uses f(n) = g(n) + h(n) where g(n) is the cost to reach node n and h(n) is the estimated cost from n to goal.

Unit 3: Adversarial Search & Games
Q7. What is alpha-beta pruning?
A7. It reduces the number of nodes evaluated in minimax by pruning branches that won't affect the outcome.

Q8. What is a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)?
A8. A problem defined by variables, domains, and constraints (e.g., Sudoku, Map coloring).

Unit 4: Knowledge Representation
Q9. Difference between propositional and first-order logic?
A9. Propositional logic deals with simple true/false values. First-order logic includes predicates, quantifiers, and relations.

Q10. What is the Wumpus World?
A10. A classic AI environment used to demonstrate logical agents navigating using perception.

Unit 5: Reasoning
Q11. What is unification?
A11. Unification is a process in logic to make different logical expressions identical by finding a substitution.

Q12. Difference between forward and backward chaining?
A12. Forward starts from facts and applies rules to reach a goal; backward starts from goals and checks if facts support it.

Unit 6: Planning
Q13. What is automated planning?
A13. Planning is the process of choosing a sequence of actions to achieve a goal.

Q14. What is STRIPS?
A14. A planning language that defines actions in terms of preconditions and effects.

üîπ Cloud Computing (CC) Viva Questions & Answers
Unit 1: Introduction
Q15. What is cloud computing?
A15. Delivery of computing services (servers, storage, databases, etc.) over the Internet (the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù).

Q16. Name cloud service models.
A16. SaaS, PaaS, IaaS.

Q17. Name deployment models in cloud computing.
A17. Public, Private, Hybrid, Community.

Unit 2: Data Storage
Q18. What is a Storage Area Network (SAN)?
A18. A high-speed network that provides access to consolidated block-level data storage.

Q19. Difference between NAS and SAN?
A19. NAS is file-level storage, SAN is block-level storage.

Unit 3: Virtualization
Q20. What is virtualization?
A20. Virtualization allows multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical machine.

Q21. What is hypervisor?
A21. Software that creates and runs virtual machines (e.g., VMware, Hyper-V, Xen).

Unit 4: Cloud Platforms
Q22. What is AWS EC2?
A22. Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud ‚Äì allows users to rent virtual machines.

Q23. What is Google App Engine?
A23. A platform to develop and host web apps in Google-managed data centers.

Unit 5: Security in Cloud
Q24. What are the main security concerns in cloud computing?
A24. Data loss, data breaches, insecure APIs, account hijacking.

Q25. Explain CIA triad in cloud security.
A25. Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability ‚Äì the foundational model for information security.

Unit 6: Advanced Techniques
Q26. What is Docker?
A26. A containerization platform that packages software into containers.

Q27. What is Kubernetes?
A27. An open-source container orchestration system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of apps.

Q28. What is edge computing?
A28. Data processing that happens at the edge of the network, near the data source.

üîπ Real-World and Practical Based Viva
Q29. How is AI used in daily life?
A29. Personal assistants (Siri, Alexa), recommendation systems (Netflix, YouTube), spam filters, facial recognition.

Q30. How is cloud used in real-world applications?
A30. Email, Google Drive, Netflix streaming, online banking, remote work apps like Zoom and Slack.

Q31. Give an example of cloud + AI integration.
A31. Google Cloud AI Platform ‚Äì used to build, train, and deploy machine learning models.
